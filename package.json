  "description": "As a teenager, learning English in Brazil, our teacher used to make us play a game: everybody should start writing a text (in English), it could be anything; a story, a dissertation, a letter to the president, a poem, etc. After a while the teacher would give a signal and all the students would pass their text to the right, get the text from someone else, read it and continue the other studentâ€™s text in the best way possible, until the next signal from the teacher and so on. The texts would usually end up with 20 to 30 lines and 4 to 6 co-writers. In the end it was always fun to see how the texts unrolled into pearls of creativity or just nonsense.",
